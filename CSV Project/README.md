# Python CSV Project
This project will serve to familiarize yourself with the CSV module
Here are the instructions: 

1. Import the "csv" module
2. Research the csv module using "dir" function
3. Identify any of the csv attributes/functions that will help you in reading the content of the csv file. Use the "help" function to get more information on these attributes/functions
4. Use the "open" method to open the file
5. using the "reader" fucntion, found in the csv module, you can assign the reader object to a variable to read the file opened using the "open" method
6. Use a "for loop" to print each row of data in the csv file.
7. Use the close method to close the file that you opened

The next portion is used to write content to a .csv file

1. Create a variable and assign it single record
2. There must be four values in the record. Each value must match: (ID,Firstname,Lastname, Dept)
3. Use the writerow function to write the new record, created in step 2, to the "writer" object
4. Make sure to use the "close" method to close out of the file once done
